<!-- Static Positioning

Static positioning is the default positioning method for all elements on a web page. Elements are positioned in the order they appear in the HTML document, and they follow the normal document flow.

When an element is statically positioned, it is unaffected by the top, right, bottom, and left properties. -->

  <style>
    div {
      position: static;
    }
  </style>
