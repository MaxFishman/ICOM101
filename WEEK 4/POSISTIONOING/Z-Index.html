<!-- Z-Index

When boxes on a web page have a combination of different positions, the boxes
(and therefore, their content) can overlap with each other, making the content
dificult to read or consume.


In the example above, the .green-box element overlaps on top of the .blue-box
element.

The z-index property controls how far back or how far forward an element should
appear on the web page when elements overlap. This can be thought of as the depth of elements, with deeper elements appearing behind shallower elements. 

The z-index property accepts integer values.
Depending on their values, the
integers instruct the browser on the order in which elements should be layered on
the web page. -->

  <style>
    .blue-box {
      background-color: blue;
      position: relative;
      z-index: 1;
    }
    .green-box {
      background-color: green;
      position: relative;
      top: -170px;
      left: 170px;
      z-index: 2;
    }
  </style>

<body>
  <div class="blue-box">
    <h1>Blue Box</h1>
    <p>This is the blue box.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="green-box">
    <h1>Green Box</h1>
    <p>This is the green box.</p>
