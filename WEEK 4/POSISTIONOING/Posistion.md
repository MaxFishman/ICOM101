# The Position Property

The primary tool for manipulating element positioning in CSS is the position property. The position property allows you to define the positioning method for an element.

## Possible Values for the Position Property

There are five possible values for this property:

static: The default positioning method, where elements are positioned based on their order in the HTML document.

relative: Similar to static positioning, but the element can be offset from its original position using top, right, bottom, and left properties.

absolute: The element is removed from the normal flow and positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor element.

fixed: The element is removed from the normal flow and positioned relative to the browser window or viewport.

sticky: A hybrid of relative and fixed positioning, the element becomes fixed once it reaches a specified position in the viewport.
