Sticky Positioning

Sticky positioning is a hybrid of relative and fixed positioning. An element with sticky positioning is treated as relatively positioned until it reaches a specified position in the viewport, at which point it becomes fixed.

In this example, the paragraph is positioned with sticky. As you scroll down the page, it remains 20 pixels from the top of the viewport once it reaches that point.
